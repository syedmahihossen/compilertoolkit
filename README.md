Compiler Toolkit 🛠️

Compiler Toolkit is a professional-grade web workbench designed to help students and developers visualize, analyze, and transform Context-Free Grammars (CFGs).

Stop calculating FIRST & FOLLOW sets by hand. This tool automates the tedious parts of compiler construction, offering a split-screen interface to write grammars and see real-time results.

Grammar Analysis

FIRST & FOLLOW Sets: Automatically computes sets for all non-terminals, handling complex dependencies and epsilon transitions.

LL(1) Parsing Table: Generates predictive parsing tables and automatically detects collisions/conflicts to determine if a grammar is valid LL(1).

Grammar Transformation

Left Recursion Removal: Detects and eliminates both immediate and indirect left recursion to make grammars suitable for top-down parsing.

Left Factoring: Automatically refactors grammars to remove common prefixes and resolve ambiguity.
